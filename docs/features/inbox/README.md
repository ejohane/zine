## Implementation Summary

### What Needs to be Built

#### New Files (3)
1. **`apps/mobile/app/(app)/(tabs)/inbox.tsx`** (400 lines)
   - Main inbox screen component
   - Uses existing CategoryTabs, SwipeableBookmarkItem

2. **`apps/mobile/hooks/useInboxBookmarks.ts`** (60 lines)
   - Fetches all active bookmarks
   - Applies client-side content type filtering

3. **`apps/mobile/hooks/useUnarchiveBookmark.ts`** (30 lines)
   - Handles undo functionality
   - Mirrors useArchiveBookmark pattern

#### Files to Update (2)
1. **`apps/mobile/lib/api.ts`** (+20 lines)
   - Update `bookmarksApi.getAll()` to support query params
   - Ensure `unarchive()` method exists

2. **`apps/mobile/app/(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`** (+10 lines)
   - Add inbox tab to navigation

#### Files to Move/Adjust (1)
1. **`apps/mobile/components/CategoryTabs.tsx`** (no changes)
   - Move or duplicate to inbox screen
   - Remove from homepage (or keep on both)

### What Already Exists

All core functionality is already built:
- ‚úÖ SwipeableBookmarkItem with gesture support
- ‚úÖ BookmarkListItem (compact variant)
- ‚úÖ useArchiveBookmark hook
- ‚úÖ Archive API endpoints
- ‚úÖ CategoryTabs component
- ‚úÖ Navigation infrastructure

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core (2-3 days)
- Create InboxScreen with bookmark list
- Add tab navigation
- Implement filtering with CategoryTabs
- Hook up bookmark detail navigation

### Phase 2: Swipe (2 days)
- Integrate SwipeableBookmarkItem
- Configure archive swipe action
- Add haptic feedback
- Implement list animations

### Phase 3: Undo (1 day)
- Create toast notification component
- Implement unarchive hook
- Add undo button + timeout logic

### Phase 4: Polish (1-2 days)
- Empty states for all filters
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Analytics tracking

**Total Estimated Effort**: 6-8 days

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Filter Strategy: Client-Side
**Decision**: Filter bookmarks on client after fetching all active bookmarks

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation (no backend changes)
- Instant filter switching (no network delay)
- Server-side can be added later with pagination

### 2. No Archive Confirmation
**Decision**: Archive immediately on swipe without confirmation dialog

**Rationale**:
- Faster triage workflow
- Matches iOS Mail pattern
- Undo mechanism provides safety net
- Reduces friction for power users

### 3. Swipe Direction: Left for Archive
**Decision**: Swipe LEFT to reveal archive action

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard (iOS Mail, Gmail)
- Right swipe reserved for "read later" (future)
- Consistent with user expectations

### 4. Undo Duration: 5 Seconds
**Decision**: Show undo toast for 5 seconds after archive

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard (Google Inbox, Gmail)
- Long enough to notice
- Short enough to not be annoying

### 5. Filter Persistence: Session Only
**Decision**: Reset filter to "All" on app restart

**Rationale**:
- Predictable behavior (always start with full list)
- Avoids confusion if user forgets filter state
- Can be made configurable in settings later

- `expo-router` - Screen navigation
- `@expo/vector-icons` - UI icons
- `@clerk/clerk-expo` - Authentication

### No New Dependencies Required
All functionality uses existing libraries in the project.

---

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] `useInboxBookmarks` filtering logic
- [ ] `useUnarchiveBookmark` mutation
- [ ] Filter category mapping

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Swipe-to-archive flow
- [ ] Undo restores bookmark
- [ ] Filter switching updates list
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh reloads data

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Complete archive + undo workflow
- [ ] Filter all content types
- [ ] Navigate to bookmark detail
- [ ] Handle network errors gracefully

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Scroll 1000 items at 60fps
- [ ] Filter switch < 100ms

## Known Limitations

### MVP Scope
- **No search**: Coming in v1.2
- **No sort options**: Coming in v1.1
- **No bulk actions**: Coming in v1.1
- **Client-side filtering only**: Server-side with pagination in v2.0

### Technical Constraints
- Filter resets on app restart (by design)
- No pagination (will add when > 500 bookmarks typical)
- Single undo (only most recent archive)

---

## Future Enhancements

### v1.1 (Next Release)
- Bulk selection mode
- Multiple sort options
- Search functionality
- View density options (compact/comfortable)

### v1.2 (Future)
- Smart filters (unread, favorited, has notes)
- Collection quick filters
- Customizable swipe actions
- Keyboard shortcuts

### v2.0 (Long-term)
- Read later queue
- Reading progress tracking
- Smart recommendations
- Offline mode
