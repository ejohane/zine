# Creator Extraction Test Results

## Test URLs

### ✅ seangoedecke.com
**URL**: https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-times-are-over/

**Metadata Available**:
- No JSON-LD author
- No article:author meta tag
- Site header: `<h3><a href="/">sean goedecke</a></h3>`
- Domain: seangoedecke.com

**Expected Result**:
- Tier 4 (Domain-based) extraction
- Name: "Sean Goedecke"
- Confidence: ~70%

### ✅ mitchellh.com
**URL**: https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing

**Metadata Available**:
```json
{
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Vibing a Non-Trivial Ghostty Feature",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Mitchell Hashimoto"
  }
}
```
- No `author` field in JSON-LD
- Has `publisher` field with personal name
- Site header: `<h1><a href="/">Mitchell Hashimoto</a></h1>`

**Expected Result** (after fix):
- Tier 1 (Structured Data) extraction via publisher field
- Name: "Mitchell Hashimoto"
- Confidence: 95%

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ 4-tier confidence-based extraction
- ✅ Context-aware personal site detection
- ✅ Domain name matching and validation
- ✅ Site header extraction with cross-validation
- ✅ Publisher field support for personal blogs
- ✅ Debug logging for troubleshooting

### Known Limitations

1. **Organization Names**: Large organizations (CNN, NYT, etc.) won't be extracted as authors even if in publisher field
2. **Avatar URLs**: Cannot extract creator avatars from most sites without API access
3. **Multiple Authors**: Currently returns only the primary author
4. **Non-Latin Names**: Domain matching works best with Latin character names

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. Start dev server: `bun dev`
2. Open mobile app and bookmark test URLs
3. Check API console for debug logs:
   ```
   [CreatorExtraction] Starting extraction for: [URL]
   [CreatorExtraction] Context: { isPersonalSite: true, ... }
   [CreatorExtraction] ✅ TIER [N]: Found creator via [method]: [name]
   ```
4. Verify creator appears in bookmark UI

### Automated Testing
```bash
cd packages/shared
bun test enhanced-metadata-extractor
```

## Debug Output Examples

### Successful Tier 1 (Structured Data)
```
[CreatorExtraction] Starting extraction for: https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing
[CreatorExtraction] Context: {
  isPersonalSite: true,
  isNewsOrganization: false,
  contentType: 'article',
  hasByline: false
}
[CreatorExtraction] ✅ TIER 1: Found creator via structured data: Mitchell Hashimoto
```

### Successful Tier 4 (Domain)
```
[CreatorExtraction] Starting extraction for: https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-times-are-over/
[CreatorExtraction] Context: {
  isPersonalSite: true,
  isNewsOrganization: false,
  contentType: 'article',
  hasByline: false
}
[CreatorExtraction] ❌ TIER 1: No structured data found
[CreatorExtraction] ❌ TIER 2: No semantic HTML found
[CreatorExtraction] ❌ TIER 3: No heuristic patterns found
[CreatorExtraction] ✅ TIER 4: Found creator via domain: Sean Goedecke (confidence: 70)
```

### Failed Extraction (News Organization)
```
[CreatorExtraction] Starting extraction for: https://www.nytimes.com/some-article
[CreatorExtraction] Context: {
  isPersonalSite: false,
  isNewsOrganization: true,
  contentType: 'news',
  hasByline: true
}
[CreatorExtraction] ❌ TIER 1: No structured data found
[CreatorExtraction] ✅ TIER 2: Found creator via semantic HTML: Jane Reporter
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: Creator not extracted from personal blog
**Symptoms**: All tiers fail despite visible author information

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check if `isPersonalSite` is true in context
2. Verify site header selector matches (`header h1 a`, `header h2 a`, etc.)
3. Check domain name pattern (should be 2-part domain for personal sites)
4. Confirm no conflicting organization patterns

**Solution**: May need to add additional header selectors or adjust domain matching logic

### Issue: Wrong creator extracted
**Symptoms**: Site branding extracted instead of article author

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check if `isNewsOrganization` is correctly detected
2. Verify Tier 2 semantic HTML selectors are finding bylines
3. Check if article has explicit author markup

**Solution**: Add domain to news organization list or improve byline detection

### Issue: Low confidence scores
**Symptoms**: Creator extracted with <50% confidence

**Debug Steps**:
1. Review cross-validation signals (domain match, site header, etc.)
2. Check if multiple extraction methods agree
3. Verify personal site indicators

**Solution**: May be acceptable for UI to show with caveat, or adjust confidence thresholds
