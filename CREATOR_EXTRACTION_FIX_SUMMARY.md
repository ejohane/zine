# Creator Extraction Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Publisher Field Support
**Problem**: Sites like mitchellh.com use `publisher` field in JSON-LD instead of `author`:
```json
{
  "@type": "Article",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Mitchell Hashimoto"
  }
}
```

**Fix**: Added publisher field extraction to Tier 1 with smart filtering to only extract personal names, not big organizations.

### 2. No Fallback to Site Header/Domain
**Problem**: Personal blogs without structured metadata (like seangoedecke.com) had no extraction path.

**Fix**: Implemented 4-tier extraction chain with domain-based extraction for personal sites.

### 3. Title Showing as URL
**Problem**: When enrichment fails completely, the system falls back to using the URL as the title.

**Root Cause**: The fallback content at line 547 of `enriched-bookmarks.ts` sets `title: validatedData.url`.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Creator Extraction
- **Tier 1 (95%)**: Structured metadata (JSON-LD, meta tags) + publisher field
- **Tier 2 (80%)**: Semantic HTML (rel="author", byline classes)
- **Tier 3 (60%)**: Heuristics ("By [Name]" patterns, copyright)
- **Tier 4 (50-70%)**: Domain-based for personal sites only

### Changes Made
1. `packages/shared/src/types.ts` - Added `extractionMethod` and `confidence` fields
2. `packages/shared/src/enhanced-metadata-extractor.ts` - Complete rewrite of creator extraction
3. Documentation files created

## Next Steps: RESTART DEV SERVER

**IMPORTANT**: The TypeScript source files are cached. You MUST restart the dev server for changes to take effect:

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
bun dev
```

## Testing After Restart

1. **Delete the existing bookmark** for mitchellh.com (to force re-enrichment)
2. **Bookmark it again**: https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing
3. **Check API logs** for:
   ```
   [CreatorExtraction] Starting extraction for: https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing
   [CreatorExtraction] Context: { isPersonalSite: true, ... }
   [CreatorExtraction] ✅ TIER 1: Found creator via structured data: Mitchell Hashimoto
   ```
4. **Verify in app**:
   - Title should be: "Vibing a Non-Trivial Ghostty Feature"
   - Creator should be: "Mitchell Hashimoto"
   - NOT "Unknown Creator"

## Expected Debug Output

### Successful Extraction
```
[EnhancedMetadataExtractor] Starting extraction for URL: https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing
[EnhancedMetadataExtractor] Detected platform: web
[CreatorExtraction] Starting extraction for: https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing
[CreatorExtraction] Context: {
  isPersonalSite: true,
  isNewsOrganization: false,
  contentType: 'article',
  hasByline: false
}
[CreatorExtraction] ✅ TIER 1: Found creator via structured data: Mitchell Hashimoto
[EnrichedBookmark] Standard enrichment result: { 
  success: true, 
  source: 'web', 
  hasContent: true, 
  hasCreator: true  ← Should be true now!
}
[EnrichedBookmark] Creator Name: Mitchell Hashimoto
```

## If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Verify Shared Package Built
```bash
cd packages/shared
bun run build
ls -la dist/enhanced-metadata-extractor.js
```

### Check 2: Clear Module Cache
```bash
# Kill all node/bun processes
killall node
killall bun

# Restart
bun dev
```

### Check 3: Check Database
The creator might already be saved incorrectly. Delete the bookmark and content records:
```sql
-- Find the bookmark
SELECT * FROM bookmarks WHERE id = '[bookmark-id]';

-- Find associated content  
SELECT * FROM content WHERE id = '[content-id]';

-- Delete to force re-enrichment
DELETE FROM bookmarks WHERE id = '[bookmark-id]';
DELETE FROM content WHERE id = '[content-id]';
```

Then bookmark the URL again fresh.

## Known Limitations

1. **Requires Dev Server Restart**: TypeScript module caching
2. **Existing Bookmarks**: Won't be automatically updated - must delete and re-create
3. **Avatar URLs**: Still not extracted for web articles (requires API access)
4. **Confidence Metadata**: Not yet displayed in UI (can be added later)
