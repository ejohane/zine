# Feed Polling Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to optimize the feed polling system for both Spotify podcasts and YouTube channels. The current implementation processes subscriptions sequentially with fixed delays, resulting in poor performance at scale. This plan details a phased approach to achieve 80-95% performance improvement while maintaining API compliance.

## Current State Analysis

### Performance Metrics (Baseline)
- **Processing Time**: ~10 seconds per 100 subscriptions
- **API Calls**: 1 call per subscription + token refresh calls
- **Database Operations**: Multiple individual queries per subscription
- **Concurrency**: None (sequential processing)
- **Rate Limiting**: Fixed 100ms delays between calls

### Identified Inefficiencies
1. Sequential processing of all subscriptions
2. No utilization of batch API endpoints
3. Fixed polling frequency regardless of activity
4. Inefficient database operations
5. No caching or deduplication optimization

## Target Performance Goals
- **Processing Time**: <30 seconds for 1000+ subscriptions
- **API Call Reduction**: 80-95% fewer calls
- **Database Operations**: 90% reduction through batching
- **Error Resilience**: Isolated failures don't block processing
- **Resource Usage**: 60% reduction through smart scheduling

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Batch API Implementation (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Implement batch fetching for both Spotify and YouTube APIs

**Completion Date**: 2025-07-30

**Implementation Summary**:
- Created unified `BatchProcessor` interface with base implementation
- Implemented `SpotifyBatchProcessor` with batch show fetching (50 shows/request)
- Implemented `YouTubeBatchProcessor` with batch channel fetching (50 channels/request)
- Refactored `FeedPollingService` to use batch processors
- Removed legacy sequential polling methods
- Type-check and build pass successfully

**Key Implementation Details**:

1. **BatchProcessor Interface** (`batch-processor.interface.ts`):
   - Abstract base class with common functionality
   - Chunking utility for splitting large arrays
   - Concurrent processing with configurable limits
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Configurable options per provider

2. **SpotifyBatchProcessor**:
   - Uses Spotify's `/shows` endpoint with multiple IDs
   - Fetches up to 50 shows in a single request
   - Maintains episode fetching with concurrency control
   - Handles null/unavailable shows gracefully

3. **YouTubeBatchProcessor**:
   - Uses YouTube's `/channels` endpoint with multiple IDs
   - Fetches up to 50 channels in a single request
   - Two-step process: get video IDs, then batch fetch details
   - Respects YouTube's lower rate limits with reduced concurrency

4. **FeedPollingService Refactor**:
   - Provider-agnostic implementation using Map of processors
   - Simplified error handling and logging
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing interfaces
   - Cleaner separation of concerns

**Performance Improvements**:
- Spotify: From 1 API call per podcast to 1 call per 50 podcasts (98% reduction)
- YouTube: From 2-3 calls per channel to ~3 calls per 50 channels (95% reduction)
- Processing time: Estimated 80-90% reduction due to batching
- Code complexity: Reduced by removing duplicate polling logic

**Challenges Encountered**:
- No existing test infrastructure in the codebase
- Had to add `getAccessToken()` methods to API classes for batch processors
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing feed item creation logic

**Pull Request**: [#23](https://github.com/ejohane/zine/pull/23)

#### Deliverables:
1. **Spotify Batch Handler**
   - Implement `getMultipleShows()` for fetching up to 50 shows per request
   - Add show metadata caching to detect new episodes
   - Create batch episode fetching for shows with updates

2. **YouTube Batch Handler**
   - Implement batch video details fetching (50 videos per request)
   - Optimize channel video listing with proper pagination

3. **Unified Batch Processor**
   - Create provider-agnostic batch processing interface
