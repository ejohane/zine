# Subscription Feature Implementation Plan

**Feature:** Multi-Subscription Content Feeds (Phase 1: Spotify Podcasts & YouTube Channels)  
**Based on:** subscription-feature.md PRD  
**Created:** July 27, 2025  
**Last Updated:** July 28, 2025

---

## Implementation Strategy

This plan breaks the subscription feature into **6 independent phases**, each deployable and testable on its own. Each phase builds value incrementally while maintaining system stability.

## üéØ Current Status: **Phase 4 Complete** - Background Polling System Operational

‚úÖ **Phases 1-4 COMPLETED** - Backend infrastructure fully operational  
üîÑ **Phase 5 NEXT** - Feed UI implementation  
‚è≥ **Phase 6 PENDING** - Integration & polish

---

## Phase 1: Database Foundation üóÑÔ∏è

**Goal:** Establish database schema and core data models for subscription system

### Database Schema (D1 + Drizzle)

  access_token TEXT NOT NULL,
  refresh_token TEXT,
  expires_at DATETIME,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (provider_id) REFERENCES subscription_providers(id),
  UNIQUE(user_id, provider_id)
);

-- Available subscriptions (podcasts, channels)
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  provider_id TEXT NOT NULL,

  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (subscription_id) REFERENCES subscriptions(id),
  UNIQUE(user_id, subscription_id)
);

-- Feed items (episodes, videos)
CREATE TABLE feed_items (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  subscription_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  external_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  published_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,

- Create `user_feed_items` entries for all subscribers
- Handle edge cases (deleted content, private videos)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Polling jobs run on schedule without manual intervention
- [x] New episodes/videos are detected within polling window
- [x] API rate limits are respected

- Feed item detail views
- Unread item indicators
- Empty states and loading states

### Navigation & Routing
```typescript
// New routes
/feed                    // Main feed page
/feed/{subscriptionId}   // Individual subscription feed
```

### Feed Display Logic
- Avatars ordered by most recent update
- Unread counts on avatars
- Vertical swipe/scroll for feed items
- Item previews with metadata

### UI Components
```typescript
// Avatar bar component
<SubscriptionAvatars subscriptions={subscriptions} />

// Feed item list
<FeedItemList items={unreadItems} onItemView={markAsRead} />

// Item preview card
<FeedItemCard 
  item={feedItem} 
  onSave={saveToBookmarks}
  onMarkRead={markAsRead}
