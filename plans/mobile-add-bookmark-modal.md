# Mobile Add Bookmark Modal Implementation Plan

## Requirements

### User Flow
1. User taps "Add Bookmark" button in the navigation bar
2. A modal opens with a URL input field
3. If user has a URL in clipboard, it automatically gets pasted into the input
4. When a valid URL is detected (either from clipboard or typing), preview automatically runs
5. As user types a URL, the app debounces (1 second) and calls the preview endpoint
6. Preview shows extracted metadata: title, description, thumbnail, source, etc.
7. User can tap "Save" to create the bookmark
8. After saving, modal closes and user returns to home page
9. Home page refreshes to show the new bookmark

### Technical Requirements
- Modal presentation using Expo Router's modal pattern
- Automatic clipboard detection and paste on modal open
- Automatic preview trigger when valid URL is detected (no preview button)
- URL input with validation and normalization
- Debounced preview API calls
- Loading states during metadata extraction
- Error handling with retry capability
- Integration with existing authentication system
- Use HeroUI Native components for consistent UI

## Design Context

### API Endpoints
- **Preview Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/bookmarks/preview`
  - Public endpoint (no auth required for basic preview)
  - Request: `{ url: string }`
  - Response: `{ data: Bookmark, source: string, cached: boolean }`
  - Supports conditional requests with ETags for caching

- **Save Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/bookmarks`
  - Requires authentication
  - Request: `{ url: string }`
  - Response: `Bookmark` object

### Existing Patterns (from Web App)
- URL validation and normalization utility
- Debounced preview with 1-second delay
- Automatic preview trigger on valid URL detection
- Skip duplicate preview calls for same URL
- Retry mechanism for failed previews
- Preview state management (preview, loading, error states)

### New Mobile-Specific Patterns
- Clipboard detection on modal mount
- Auto-paste valid URLs from clipboard
- Immediate preview trigger for clipboard URLs (no debounce)
- Debounced preview for manually typed URLs

### HeroUI Native Components to Use
- `Button` - For navigation bar button and save action
- `TextField` - For URL input with label and error states
- `Card` - For preview display
- `Spinner` - For loading states
- `HeroUINativeProvider` - Already wrapping the app

### Expo Router Modal Setup
- Create modal screen as `app/(app)/add-bookmark.tsx`
- Configure in layout with `presentation: 'modal'`
- Use `router.back()` or `router.dismiss()` to close
- Handle platform-specific dismiss behavior

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Navigation Bar Button & Modal Setup ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Add navigation bar button** ✅
   - Modified `app/(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to add "Add" tab in the tab bar
   - Created `app/(app)/(tabs)/add.tsx` as a trigger screen that opens the modal
   - Tab uses plus icon with "Add" label in the tab navigation
   - Tab immediately redirects to `/(app)/add-bookmark` modal when selected
   - After opening modal, automatically returns to home tab

2. **Create modal route** ✅
   - Created `app/(app)/add-bookmark.tsx` modal screen
   - Configured in `app/(app)/_layout.tsx` with `presentation: 'modal'`
   - Modal properly configured with Stack.Screen options
   - Platform-specific status bar handling for iOS

3. **Basic modal UI structure** ✅
   - Header with centered "Add Bookmark" title and close (X) button
   - Close button dismisses modal using `router.back()`
   - Placeholder content area for future URL input and preview
   - Footer with disabled Save button using HeroUI Native Button component
   - Proper SafeAreaView wrapping for device-specific safe areas
   - Clean styling with consistent colors and spacing

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `apps/mobile/app/(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Added header with navigation button
- `apps/mobile/app/(app)/_layout.tsx` - Configured modal route
- `apps/mobile/app/(app)/add-bookmark.tsx` - Created modal screen component

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Expo dev server runs successfully
- ✅ Modal route properly configured
- ✅ Button component from design system working correctly

### Phase 2: URL Input & Validation ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Create URL input component** ✅

   - Configured keyboard type as 'url' with proper autoCapitalize and autoCorrect settings
   - Added placeholder "Enter a URL to bookmark" with proper styling
   - Custom styled input with error state styling

2. **Implement clipboard detection** ✅
   - Successfully integrated Expo Clipboard API (`expo-clipboard` package)
   - Checks clipboard content on modal mount using `useEffect`
   - Validates clipboard content with `looksLikeUrl` helper function
   - Auto-pastes valid URLs into input field
   - Shows "Pasted from clipboard" indicator with clipboard icon
   - Gracefully handles clipboard read failures

3. **Implement URL validation** ✅
   - Created `lib/url-validation.ts` with three utility functions:
     - `validateAndNormalizeUrl`: Full validation with error messages
     - `looksLikeUrl`: Lenient check for clipboard detection
     - `extractDomain`: Helper for future preview display
   - Handles URLs with/without protocol (auto-adds https://)
   - Validates URL format and normalizes to standard form
   - Shows validation errors only after user interaction
   - Clears errors immediately when user starts typing

4. **State management** ✅
   - `url`: Tracks current input value
   - `error`: Tracks validation error message
   - `hasInteracted`: Prevents premature error display
   - `isValidUrl`: Enables/disables save button
   - `wasAutoPasted`: Shows clipboard indicator
   - `lastValidatedUrl`: Prevents duplicate validation calls

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `apps/mobile/lib/url-validation.ts` - URL validation utilities
