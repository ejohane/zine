{"id":"zine-9uz","title":"Mobile Replicache Integration","description":"Mobile Replicache integration for Expo app (client, hooks, provider, auth wiring).\n\nDependencies: \n- zine-vnf (app scaffold with ClerkProvider)\n- zine-akb (@zine/shared mutators/types/key helpers)\n- zine-phq (Clerk auth helpers for getToken)\n- zine-z0b (server push/pull endpoints must be deployed for full testing, but client can be built first)\n\nGoal: initialize Replicache on mobile with Clerk-based auth, reactive subscriptions, and clean lifecycle handling.\n\nDeliverables\n1. Replicache Client Factory (lib/replicache.ts)\n   ```typescript\n   import { Replicache } from \"replicache\";\n   import { mutators } from \"@zine/shared\";\n   \n   export function createReplicacheClient(userId: string, getToken: () =\u003e Promise\u003cstring | null\u003e) {\n     return new Replicache({\n       name: `zine-${userId}`,\n       licenseKey: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_REPLICACHE_LICENSE_KEY!,\n       pushURL: `${process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/replicache/push`,\n       pullURL: `${process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/replicache/pull`,\n       mutators,\n       auth: async () =\u003e {\n         const token = await getToken();\n         return token ? `Bearer ${token}` : null;\n       },\n       // React Native specific: use default IndexedDB-based kvStore\n       // pullInterval: 60000, // optional: 60s poll\n     });\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Replicache Context \u0026 Provider (hooks/useReplicache.tsx)\n   - ReplicacheContext with Replicache instance or null\n   - ReplicacheProvider component:\n     * Use useUser() and useAuth() from Clerk\n     * Create client on sign-in (when userId available)\n     * Close client on sign-out\n     * Handle user switch: close old client, create new\n   - useReplicache() hook returning client (throws if used outside provider)\n\n3. useSubscribe Hook (hooks/useSubscribe.ts)\n   - Wrapper around Replicache's subscribe\n   - Generic: useSubscribe\u003cT\u003e(query: (tx: ReadTransaction) =\u003e Promise\u003cT\u003e, deps?: any[])\n   - Returns { data: T | undefined, loading: boolean, error: Error | null }\n   - Handles subscription lifecycle (subscribe/unsubscribe)\n\n4. Convenience Query Hooks (hooks/queries.ts)\n   - useInboxItems(): UserItem[] - items where state === 'INBOX'\n   - useBookmarkedItems(): UserItem[] - items where state === 'BOOKMARKED'  \n   - useItem(id: string): Item | undefined\n   - useSources(): Source[]\n   - All use key prefixes from @zine/shared\n\n5. Provider Integration (update app/_layout.tsx)\n   - Add ReplicacheProvider inside ClerkLoaded, wrapping navigation\n   - Provider hierarchy:\n     ```\n     ClerkProvider\n       ClerkLoaded\n         ReplicacheProvider  \u003c-- add here\n           UniwindProvider\n             HeroUIProvider\n               Stack\n     ```\n\n6. Error Handling\n   - onOnlineStatusChange callback for connection status\n   - Log push/pull errors for debugging\n   - Optional: toast notification on sync errors\n   - Graceful degradation: app works offline with stale data\n\n7. Storage \u0026 Lifecycle\n   - Replicache uses IndexedDB by default (works in RN via polyfill)\n   - On user switch: close() old client before creating new\n   - On sign-out: close() client and optionally clear storage\n   - Document kvStore behavior in RN context\n\n8. Mutation Helpers (hooks/useMutations.ts)\n   - useMutations() hook returning bound mutation functions:\n     ```typescript\n     const { bookmarkItem, archiveItem, addSource, removeSource } = useMutations();\n     // Each returns Promise\u003cvoid\u003e and handles optimistic updates\n     ```\n   - Wraps replicache.mutate.X calls\n\n9. Environment Variables\n   - EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL: worker base URL\n   - EXPO_PUBLIC_REPLICACHE_LICENSE_KEY: license key\n   - Document in .env.example\n\nParallelization\n- Client factory first (lib/replicache.ts)\n- Then in parallel:\n  * ReplicacheProvider (hooks/useReplicache.tsx)\n  * useSubscribe hook (hooks/useSubscribe.ts)\n- Convenience queries after useSubscribe\n- useMutations after provider\n- Layout wiring last\n\nAcceptance\n- Client initializes when user signs in (check console for Replicache logs)\n- Client closes when user signs out (no memory leak)\n- useSubscribe returns live data that updates on mutations\n- Optimistic mutations update UI immediately\n- Push/pull hit Worker endpoints with bearer token\n- Auth errors are handled (401 triggers re-auth or error state)\n- Works on iOS and Android in dev build\n- User switch creates fresh client (no data bleed)\n\nFile Paths (workers should reserve these)\n- apps/mobile/lib/replicache.ts\n- apps/mobile/hooks/useReplicache.tsx\n- apps/mobile/hooks/useSubscribe.ts\n- apps/mobile/hooks/queries.ts\n- apps/mobile/hooks/useMutations.ts","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-13T13:11:22.836417-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T13:30:09.393072-06:00"}

Constants (src/constants/index.ts)\n   - Provider list, state enums, content type mappings.\n   - Default provider→contentType mapping (YOUTUBE→VIDEO, SPOTIFY→PODCAST, etc.).\n\nParallelization\n- Define domain types first (types/domain.ts).\n- Then schemas, API/sync types, mutators, and constants can proceed in parallel.\n- Key conventions should be done with domain types.\n- Barrel exports (src/index.ts) last.\n\nAcceptance\n- bun run build generates dist/ with .js and .d.ts files.\n- bun run typecheck passes inside packages/shared.\n- Mobile/worker can import via @zine/shared using workspace protocol.\n- Mutators and schemas align (no type/schema drift).\n- Key helpers produce correct formats: itemKey(\"abc\") → \"item/abc\".\n\nFile Paths (workers should reserve these)\n- packages/shared/src/types/domain.ts\n- packages/shared/src/types/sync.ts\n- packages/shared/src/schemas/index.ts\n- packages/shared/src/mutators/index.ts\n- packages/shared/src/constants/index.ts\n- packages/shared/src/constants/keys.ts\n- packages/shared/src/index.ts\n- packages/shared/tsup.config.ts","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-13T13:11:00.462086-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T13:47:38.258711-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-13T13:47:38.258711-06:00"}

Schema Definition (src/durable-objects/schema.ts)\n   - Version-tracked migrations array\n   - Tables:\n     * canonical_items: id, content_type, provider_id, canonical_url, title, summary, author, publisher, published_at, thumbnail_url, duration, created_at, updated_at\n     * user_items: id, item_id REFERENCES canonical_items, state TEXT CHECK(state IN ('INBOX','BOOKMARKED','ARCHIVED')), ingested_at, bookmarked_at, archived_at, created_at, updated_at\n     * sources: id, provider, provider_id, name, config JSON, created_at, updated_at\n     * provider_items_seen: id, provider, provider_item_id, source_id, first_seen_at (for ingestion idempotency)\n     * replicache_clients: id (clientGroupID), last_mutation_id INTEGER, updated_at\n     * replicache_meta: key PRIMARY KEY, value (for global version/cookie tracking)\n   - Indexes: \n     * provider_items_seen(provider, provider_item_id) UNIQUE\n     * user_items(item_id) UNIQUE\n     * user_items(state, ingested_at) for list queries\n\n2. UserDO Class (src/durable-objects/user-do.ts)\n   - Export class UserDO implements DurableObject\n   - Constructor: save state reference, initialize sql from state.storage.sql\n   - fetch() router for internal routes: /init, /push, /pull, /ingest, /cleanup\n\n3. /init Handler\n   - Run migrations using db helper\n   - Initialize replicache_meta with version = 0 if not exists\n   - Idempotent (safe to call multiple times)\n   - Return { success: true, schemaVersion }\n\n4. /push Handler (Replicache server push)\n   - Parse PushRequest body (validate with Zod from @zine/shared)\n   - For each mutation in order:\n     a. Check replicache_clients for clientID → if mutation.id \u003c= last_mutation_id, skip (idempotent)\n     b. Apply mutation using mutator logic (import from @zine/shared or define server-side equivalents)\n     c. Update replicache_clients.last_mutation_id for that clientID\n     d. Increment global version in replicache_meta\n   - Wrap all mutations in single transaction for atomicity\n   - Return { } on success (empty response per Replicache spec)\n\n5. /pull Handler (Replicache server pull)\n   - Parse PullRequest body with { clientGroupID, cookie }\n   - cookie is the last version client received (or null for first pull)\n   - Query all changes since cookie version:\n     * Items, UserItems, Sources where updated_at version \u003e cookie\n     * Generate PatchOperations: { op: \"put\", key, value } or { op: \"del\", key }\n   - Build lastMutationIDChanges map from replicache_clients\n   - Return PullResponse: { cookie: currentVersion, lastMutationIDChanges, patch }\n\n6. Version Tracking Strategy\n   - Global monotonic version in replicache_meta (key=\"version\")\n   - Each row has version column updated on change\n   - Pull queries: SELECT * FROM table WHERE version \u003e $cookie\n   - Simpler than CVR for single-user DO\n\n7. /ingest Handler (optional, for provider ingestion)\n   - Receive raw provider items batch\n   - Check provider_items_seen for idempotency\n   - Create/update canonical_items and user_items (state=INBOX)\n   - Schedule enrichment via alarm if needed\n   - Return { processed: number, skipped: number }\n\n8. /cleanup Handler (user deletion)\n   - Drop all user data (called from user.deleted webhook)\n   - Or archive to cold storage if needed\n   - Return { success: true }\n\n9. Alarm Support\n   - alarm() method for scheduled tasks (source refresh, enrichment retry)\n   - Safe reentrancy: check if work still needed before proceeding\n   - Use state.storage.setAlarm(Date.now() + delay) to schedule\n   - Log alarm execution for observability\n\n10. Error Handling\n    - 400 for invalid input (bad JSON, schema validation failure)\n    - 500 for internal errors (wrap in try/catch, log context)\n    - Always return JSON { error, code, details? }\n\nParallelization\n- Schema definition first (sequential)\n- /init handler immediately after schema\n- /push and /pull handlers can proceed in parallel once schema exists\n- Alarms independent after class skeleton\n- Tests after handlers are implemented\n\nAcceptance\n- DO initializes schema on /init idempotently (call twice, no error)\n- Push updates state and lastMutationID correctly\n- Duplicate mutations (same mutation.id) are skipped\n- Pull returns correct cookie/patch for creates/updates/deletes\n- Pull includes accurate lastMutationIDChanges per clientID\n- Alarm handler executes without corrupting state\n- All handlers return appropriate status codes\n- Tests pass under bun test (Miniflare)\n\nFile Paths (workers should reserve these)\n- apps/worker/src/durable-objects/user-do.ts\n- apps/worker/src/durable-objects/schema.ts\n- apps/worker/src/durable-objects/handlers/init.ts\n- apps/worker/src/durable-objects/handlers/push.ts\n- apps/worker/src/durable-objects/handlers/pull.ts\n- apps/worker/src/durable-objects/handlers/ingest.ts\n- apps/worker/src/durable-objects/user-do.test.ts","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-13T13:11:09.273723-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T13:26:39.851456-06:00"}

{"id":"zine-phq","title":"Clerk Authentication Integration","description":"Clerk authentication integration across worker and mobile.\n\nDependencies: zine-shu (worker skeleton with auth helpers). Note: UserDO (zine-hcb) is a runtime dependency only – webhook calls /init on the DO, but the webhook code doesn't need DO implementation to be written first.\n\nGoal: verify Clerk tokens on API, handle lifecycle webhooks, and expose mobile auth helpers.\n\nDeliverables\n1. Worker Dependencies\n   - Add svix package for webhook signature verification\n   - Add jose for JWT verification (may already be in zine-shu)\n\n2. Webhook Route (src/routes/auth.ts)\n   - POST /api/auth/webhook endpoint\n   - Verify Svix signature using CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET env var\n   - Extract headers: svix-id, svix-timestamp, svix-signature\n   - On missing headers: 400 { error: \"Missing webhook headers\", code: \"INVALID_WEBHOOK\" }\n   - On invalid signature: 400 { error: \"Invalid signature\", code: \"SIGNATURE_MISMATCH\" }\n   - Parse webhook payload for event type\n\n3. Webhook Handlers\n   a. user.created handler:\n      - Extract userId from payload.data.id\n      - Get DO stub: env.USER_DO.idFromName(userId)\n      - Call stub.fetch(\"http://do/init\") to provision user\n      - Idempotent: repeated calls are safe (DO /init is idempotent)\n      - Log: { event: \"user.created\", userId, success }\n   \n   b. user.deleted handler:\n      - Extract userId from payload.data.id\n      - Get DO stub and call stub.fetch(\"http://do/cleanup\")\n      - Or mark user as deleted for retention period\n      - Log: { event: \"user.deleted\", userId, success }\n\n4. Idempotency/Deduplication\n   - Store svix-id in KV or DO to prevent double processing\n   - On duplicate: return 200 immediately (already processed)\n   - TTL: 7 days for svix-id records\n\n5. Auth Token Verification (src/lib/auth.ts) - enhance from zine-shu\n   - verifyClerkToken should fetch JWKS from Clerk\n   - Cache JWKS with appropriate TTL (1 hour)\n   - Verify: iss (Clerk issuer), exp, signature\n   - Return parsed payload with sub (userId)\n\n6. Mobile Auth Helpers (apps/mobile/lib/auth.ts)\n   - getAuthToken(): Promise\u003cstring | null\u003e using Clerk's getToken()\n   - getUserId(): string | null from useUser() hook\n   - tokenCache implementation for ClerkProvider:\n     ```typescript\n     const tokenCache = {\n       getToken: async (key: string) =\u003e SecureStore.getItemAsync(key),\n       saveToken: (key: string, token: string) =\u003e SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, token),\n     }\n     ```\n   - Export hook: useAuthToken() for components needing token\n\n7. ClerkProvider Wiring (in mobile root layout)\n   - Document where ClerkProvider should be placed\n   - Document required env vars: EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\n\n8. Environment Variables Documentation\n   - Worker: CLERK_SECRET_KEY (for JWT verification), CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET (for Svix)\n   - Mobile: EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\n   - Document staging vs production values approach\n\n9. Error Handling\n   - Webhook failures: log full error, return 500 (Clerk will retry)\n   - Token verification failures: 401 with specific code\n   - Log failed webhook signature attempts (potential security issue)\n\nParallelization\n- Webhook route + handlers can proceed in parallel with mobile auth helpers\n- Both depend only on zine-shu existing (not on zine-hcb being complete)\n- Mobile helpers can be done fully independently\n\nAcceptance\n- Webhook signature verification enforced; missing headers return 400\n- Bad signature returns 400 with SIGNATURE_MISMATCH code\n- user.created provisions DO successfully (calls /init)\n- Repeated user.created events are idempotent\n- user.deleted cleans up user data\n- Mobile getAuthToken() returns valid bearer token\n- Mobile tokenCache persists across app restarts\n- Unauthorized API calls blocked with 401/403\n\nFile Paths (workers should reserve these)\n- apps/worker/src/routes/auth.ts\n- apps/worker/src/routes/auth.test.ts\n- apps/mobile/lib/auth.ts","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-13T13:11:15.794167-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T13:27:33.982043-06:00"}

{"id":"zine-z0b","title":"Replicache Sync API Endpoints","description":"Replicache sync HTTP endpoints that route to the per-user UserDO.\n\nDependencies: zine-shu (worker skeleton with auth middleware), zine-hcb (UserDO with /push and /pull handlers), zine-akb (PushRequest/PullRequest schemas).\n\nGoal: authenticated /api/replicache/push and /pull that validate payloads, extract userId, and forward to the correct DO instance.\n\nDeliverables\n1. Route Module (src/routes/sync.ts)\n   - Export syncRoutes as Hono\u003cEnv\u003e router\n   - Apply auth middleware to all routes (ensures userId is set)\n   - Add requestId correlation in logs\n\n2. POST /push Endpoint\n   - Parse JSON body\n   - Validate against PushRequestSchema from @zine/shared (Zod)\n   - On validation failure: return 400 { error: \"Invalid request\", code: \"VALIDATION_ERROR\", details: zodErrors }\n   - Extract userId from c.get(\"userId\")\n   - Get DO stub: env.USER_DO.idFromName(userId), env.USER_DO.get(id)\n   - Forward request to DO: stub.fetch(\"http://internal/push\", { method: \"POST\", body, headers })\n   - Set timeout: 30s for DO request\n   - Return DO response (pass through status code and body)\n\n3. POST /pull Endpoint\n   - Same pattern as /push\n   - Validate against PullRequestSchema\n   - Forward to DO /pull\n   - Return PullResponse from DO\n\n4. Request Validation Details\n   - PushRequest: { clientGroupID: string, mutations: Mutation[], schemaVersion?: number }\n   - PullRequest: { clientGroupID: string, cookie: number | null, schemaVersion?: number }\n   - schemaVersion optional but logged for debugging/versioning\n\n5. DO Routing Pattern\n   ```typescript\n   const doId = c.env.USER_DO.idFromName(userId);\n   const stub = c.env.USER_DO.get(doId);\n   const response = await stub.fetch(new Request(\"http://do/push\", {\n     method: \"POST\",\n     headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n     body: JSON.stringify(validatedBody),\n   }));\n   ```\n\n6. Error Handling\n   - 401: Missing/invalid auth token (from middleware)\n   - 400: Invalid request body (validation failed)\n   - 500: DO error or timeout (log full error, return sanitized message)\n   - Pass through DO error responses (4xx from DO becomes 4xx from endpoint)\n\n7. Logging\n   - Log request: { requestId, userId, clientGroupID, mutationCount (for push) }\n   - Log response: { requestId, status, duration }\n   - Log errors with full context for debugging\n\n8. Tests (src/routes/sync.test.ts)\n   - 401 on missing Authorization header\n   - 401 on invalid/expired token\n   - 400 on malformed JSON\n   - 400 on schema validation failure (missing clientGroupID, etc.)\n   - 200 on valid push (mock DO response)\n   - 200 on valid pull (mock DO response)\n   - DO error propagation (DO returns 500 → endpoint returns 500)\n   - Timeout handling\n\nParallelization\n- Auth middleware must exist first (from zine-shu)\n- Push and pull route implementations can proceed in parallel\n- Tests after both routes are implemented\n\nAcceptance\n- Authenticated requests reach the correct DO (userId-based routing works)\n- Unauthenticated requests return 401 with structured error\n- Validation rejects malformed payloads with 400 and details\n- Push/pull return DO responses with correct status codes\n- Timeout is enforced (30s default)\n- Tests pass under bun test (Vitest workers pool)\n\nFile Paths (workers should reserve these)\n- apps/worker/src/routes/sync.ts\n- apps/worker/src/routes/sync.test.ts","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-13T13:11:13.065942-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T13:27:10.462097-06:00"}
